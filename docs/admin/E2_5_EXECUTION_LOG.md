## Current checkpoint

Test checkpoint `de0f5a2e129f3a03259c80ae9780fe1a6172cd36` adds adapter-level method enforcement evidence: Scrapy middleware forwards the actual request method to the live guard and blocks POST, and Playwright's browser route guard forwards and blocks a POST subrequest. The Playwright fixture also models live forbidden-path denial explicitly. CircleCI `backend-verification` **passed** for this exact checkpoint: https://app.circleci.com/workflow/3b37a37c-6bc3-42b3-884a-df075b914a21/job/e2176682-c1ee-48e0-9668-65c6362c01b2.

Preceding test checkpoint `eb079ff866956e7497b3fe03b8c6ca9a3032b6f0` expands end-to-end Admin manual-acquisition coverage to fourteen persisted-policy mutation cases. Each changes source/connector state after the first Greenhouse request, then verifies that the second request is never issued and the run is persisted as `RESTRICTED`. Cases cover source configuration/base URL/type, permission-review reference/timestamp/revocation, connector configuration/capabilities/limits/type/version/active configuration version, and source/connector deactivation. Test mutation values are deliberately distinct from initial values. CircleCI `backend-verification` **passed** for that checkpoint: https://app.circleci.com/workflow/5abdab18-1cdb-4e68-9c39-d832efa8843a/job/2eebec71-251e-40b8-b540-8f8e16bb90fb.

Preceding checkpoint `cd3f027ce8590ac82c6ecb6868de6b09f3441295` introduced the first six end-to-end Admin-path policy-mutation cases; its CI run also passed: https://app.circleci.com/workflow/e4a519e4-a959-4ac7-be81-407d9705264e/job/450369b5-5834-46e5-b8cb-9873cef44faf.

Preceding test checkpoint `74aec969131a4f0c54b66463b4764e32105b3be6` expands the SQL-backed live-policy guard regression from four to fifteen mutation cases. In addition to forbidden-rule changes and permission revocation, it verifies that changes to source configuration/base URL/type, permission-review reference/timestamp, connector configuration/capabilities/limits/type/version/active configuration version, and source/connector activation state are rejected before a second request. This is database-backed guard testing; it counts the first permitted request and asserts the second guard call raises, rather than claiming live provider execution. CircleCI `backend-verification` **passed** for that checkpoint: https://app.circleci.com/workflow/7b9c83d3-de49-44d5-adae-8919269de1a7/job/2d892cd6-bb21-4da2-9f6e-52f4b3f48435.

Code checkpoint `bfb44c1a14218f6765c4bb657d9510c44159dfcf` added the two deterministic adapter-level live-policy regressions. Greenhouse is checked before both board and jobs requests; denial on the second check prevents the second HTTP request. RSS/Atom invokes the live guard for the feed URL and a denial prevents the HTTP request entirely. Both use in-memory/no-network test clients. CircleCI `backend-verification` **passed** for that checkpoint: https://app.circleci.com/workflow/9548878c-254c-4275-af08-d2ff2d3b942c/job/5d3eb089-11a9-4c91-98a0-1472d96a2e39.

Prior checkpoint `0a4492a395f62ac23c1b565d8c4c545d556947de` removed duplicate live-policy checks in JSON API and RSS/Atom request setup and Greenhouse's per-request helper. It includes connector capability/limit revalidation and registered JSON API tests proving active-version publication (1→2) and rollback (2→1) block the next page. Its CircleCI run also passed: https://app.circleci.com/workflow/cdbee3f2-8f54-45dd-9999-30beaa0d8745/job/24ec014d-0718-4eed-83a0-8070e9d12894.

Local tests and live/staging provider behavior remain NOT VERIFIED. No merge or deployment occurred.

## Resolution progress

- **E2.5-01 — RESOLVED (repository/CI scope):** Admin manual acquisition uses the shared live guard. A PostgreSQL/API regression test proves a forbidden rule activated after request one blocks request two and records the run as RESTRICTED.
- **E2.5-02 — RESOLVED (repository/CI scope):** Scrapy passes a non-secret policy snapshot to its worker, fails closed if live policy cannot load or the persisted snapshot differs, and checks requests through downloader middleware. It calls the live guard before enqueuing initial and pagination URLs, then checks again before network access. Tests cover worker guard initialization, snapshot mismatch, middleware calls across requests, SQL-backed changes, and a discovered-link regression proving a forbidden pagination target is rejected before enqueue. Live/staging subprocess behavior remains NOT VERIFIED.
- **E2.5-03 — RESOLVED (repository/CI scope, fail-closed):** JobSpy returns RESTRICTED with `JOBSPY_LIVE_POLICY_UNSUPPORTED` whenever the guarded acquisition callback is supplied. This prevents unsupported third-party transport from bypassing fresh policy. Tradeoff: JobSpy is unavailable through guarded acquisition until a controllable transport is implemented.
- **E2.5-04 — OPEN (I):** Expanded regression cases cover source configuration/base URL/type changes, connector configuration/type/version changes, active configuration-version changes, source/connector deactivation, permission-review reference/time mutation, and rejection of POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE/HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE under the current GET-only guard. The governing task list requires methods to follow an approved policy but does not specify the allowed-method set; GET-only is an implementation restriction, not an established product decision. That method-policy decision remains unresolved and must not be inferred. Revalidation compares connector capabilities and limits as well as connector configuration/version/type. JSON API checks every page URL; RSS/Atom checks its feed URL; Greenhouse checks both board and jobs URLs. Registered JSON API tests prove active-version publication (1→2) and rollback (2→1) block the next page. New Greenhouse and RSS/Atom regressions prove live-guard denial prevents the relevant HTTP request. The SQL-backed mutation matrix now covers the source/connector fields listed above, but adapter-level acceptance across every supported connector and entry path remains incomplete.

## Mandatory next queue

| Position | Item / classification | Required next action | Exit evidence |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | **E2.5-04 — OPEN (I)** Method/configuration acceptance | Complete approved-method coverage across applicable paths; prove source configuration and active-version publication/rollback changes stop the next request through registered acquisition, and extend deterministic cross-entry-path acceptance. | Deterministic tests and passing exact-head CI; unresolved paths explicitly remain open. |
| 2 | **L1.5 — PARTIAL** URL acquisition and SSRF review | Focused regression tests now cover Scrapy discovered-link rejection before enqueue and Playwright live-policy rejection of browser subresources. Still verify DNS/private-address edge cases, concurrent policy changes, redirects and full cross-path acceptance. | Requirement-level security matrix and tests; claims limited to proven behavior. |

## Overall gates

**E2.5 remains OPEN (I)** until every supported acquisition path proves fresh enforcement before each applicable network request, or is deliberately disabled with tested fail-closed behavior. **L1.5 remains PARTIAL.** A0.2–A0.6 remain PARTIAL and the A0 exit gate remains NOT PASSED.
